          We discuss and acknowledge Porter Davis heading into liquidation, but with respect to those involved, our focus shifts to providing valuable insights to those who are considering buying right now. We give you a genuine insight into how builders’ pricing really works, explaining how the last 2 years has impacted builders… and ultimately clients, trades and suppliers as well. We explain the cause and effect of material shortages, delays and price increases and we also share some genuine reasons as to why you could consider purchasing now rather than waiting.

      <p>Introduction 0:07 </p>
      <p>Welcome to the home building hub, your essential podcast guide to building your new home, hosted by industry experts, Colin Bishop and Darren Brennan, this conversational podcast, we'll help better educate you about all things new home building, so you can avoid costly mistakes and enjoy your building experience to the fullest, no matter which home builder you choose.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Colin 0:31 </p>
      <p>Hi there, folks. It's Colin here, and welcome to the home building hub. And I'm sitting here with co host, Darren Brennan, how are you? Darren? You're good.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Darren 0:40 </p>
      <p>Fantastic, Mike, thank you go really well excited about the podcast, we're really excited about what isn't gonna bring</p>
      <br>
      <p>Colin 0:48 </p>
      <p>it this is the first intro episode is going to be really brief, which is gonna touch on a few topics for you, we'll introduce ourselves, we'll share our experience with you in the in the new home building industry. We'll reveal why we're doing this podcast. And probably most importantly, we're just going to, I guess, cover how this podcast will provide insights to you. And really help provide more value and better education when it comes to your journey of finding the right new home builder for your, your needs and your wants. Okay, so before we begin, we will start with a disclaimer over to you as you can kick this one off</p>
      <br>
      <p>Darren 1:22 </p>
      <p>I've got the fun of doing the disclaimer. So hey, guys, whilst we're all about providing you with value, this podcast should not be considered as legal or financial advice. It contains general information only. And you should seek out independent professional advice on your personal situation before making any legal or financial decisions. So we're ticking the boxes for the lawyers out there. Yeah, so please make sure you're just seeking their own advice. Take us as, as you will. But we can't give any direct advice to you personally on this front. So thank you.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Colin 2:00 </p>
      <p>well done. So I guess to get straight into it, Darren and I, I mean, we've worked together for I guess known each other for a number of years, Darren actually put me on in this industry as a sales consultant, back in 2012. So we've been in this game for a long time. And we just felt that there's an opportunity for us to come in. And we'll talk about our history in a bit more detail shortly. But essentially, I'm from one company called H and L Victoria. And we do full turnkey premium house and land packages or homes. And Darren can introduce a bit more detail. But he's from Metricon. And everyone knows who Metricon is, obviously. And the point is, we're not here to talk about our businesses, we're here to use our experience come together and provide you with some really independent, and I guess, objective information and advice and tips and tricks. And we'll we'll have some guests on to try and help you navigate through the process. And we just feel there's a lot of confusion there. And what we want to do is help declutter that for you through a range of different topics, okay, so that that's really what this podcast is going to be covering Daz, isn't it?</p>
      <br>
      <p>Darren 3:06 </p>
      <p>Absolutely. And I think as it evolves, call, we'd love to talk about the topics that that the listeners are keen to, you know, hear. So we've got a whole lineup of topics. But also, if you've got something that you would find value in, we'd really love to hear about that and be able to come back to you with our knowledge. And if we don't, if there's a knowledge gap there from us, we'd love to bring in some of the people we know from the industry and the broader community that can really touch on those subjects and bring value back to you on in that space. So that's really what the podcasts about, you know, bringing value to you, the listener, so excited about that.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Colin 3:46 </p>
      <p>And one thing I'd add to that is we're not if you're going to listen to our podcast, it's what you can be looking forward to is we're not really gonna get to fluffy with all the pretty things it's not really about that there's enough information on builder websites to talk about why they're good and, and you know, for you to make a decision on who you're choosing, what we want to do is get into the nitty gritty and get to the facts and get to the points and get to the really helpful information and education for you. That that we suspect people really want to hear and it saves you having to go to a builder or to leave your name number and you know, information with them just to extract some information in general, we want to give you that, that homework and that that preparation in advance so you better educate and you're ready to roll when you do want to start talking to builders and talking about the quoting stage and everything thereafter. And this can go deeper through the process as we continue with the episodes. Okay, so what we'll do is we'll just go down</p>
      <br>
      <p>Darren 4:45 </p>
      <p>the journey of building it's one it's a long journey, you know, it doesn't happen overnight. So it but it's also confusing journey for a lot of people and hopefully what we can do is, is remove some of that confusion and give you some clarity and give you an independent opinion of those scenarios and coming from two different types of builders now even and then from our broad experience, and when we both worked at multiple builders and been in the industry a long time. So being able to bring that knowledge to the table, I think it's going to be really helpful.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Colin 5:18 </p>
      <p>Yeah, yeah, no doubt. So I think let's share a bit about our experience Darren, so I guess it helps validate if anything for listeners who, who are thinking about continuing on with with listening to our podcast, we're probably not going to share this more than once we're doing it for the sake of validation and giving you the confidence that we're coming from a place of experience and coming from a place of care and providing value to so as far as my experience and Darren can go next. I have about 10 years, or just over 10 years experience in our industry. As I said, Darren put me on back at the start as a sales consultant. And I have been through so many different roles and levels and even moving currently, we're in Victoria, we've have actually moved my family to state to to Queensland and sort of learn a little a lot of differences between states there. And so for me personally, I've been through sales marketing strategy structure process systems and been from a sales consultant to a regional manager to a state manager to a national manager and, and that really gave me insights into so many different levels, so many different people. And and I guess for me, I sort of say that I feel like I've got 10 years of experience in about three years during that, that transition. And that was with a major sort of volume builder at that time. So that was really good experience. And it gives us an insight because we've been dealing with clients, we've been dealing with consultants dealing clients, we're dealing with administration, people and developers and anything and everything that that connects you to I guess what it is that you're you're about to go through in terms of your journey, we've got some experience in that. So we're happy to share that with you. The last thing I'd say is one of the most notable things for me personally, one of the things I'm really proud of is after the volume builder, I did go to a sort of a midsize builder, and a company just to help them rebrand a little bit their their direction and how they looked in the market. And that took about two years. And I'm really proud of what I did there. And I was really grateful for those guys giving me the keys to let me do that, and really helping and support. So that gave me an insight into a different size builder. And to a builder that's telling a different market to the volume one I came from, or come from I should say, Okay, so as I said briefly before, now, I'm a general manager of a company called HCl, Victoria, we do the premium turnkey, full, sort of turnkey house and land packages or custom homes. And that, essentially, we act as a new home broker, which means that we don't we're not the actual builder, but we have a specific panel of builders. So we bit like a finance broker does for you. When it comes to picking the right lender, we have the ability to do that with the right builder for your circumstances. Okay, so that's probably enough on me. I think I'll hand over to you, Diaz. And tell us a bit more about yourself.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Darren 8:03 </p>
      <p>Yeah, cool. So I started back in the industry about 16 years ago now. It's amazing how time flies. In fact, that was the Easter weekend that I started in the industry. So you know, around that time right now. I currently work for Metricon I'm the regional sales manager for regional West. I've spent time with other volume builders, in state sales manager roles. I started as a sales consultant sitting in the garage on the weekend selling homes. And, you know, what I really love about this industry is that ability to help people into their new home but also that ability and Collins a great example out of bringing people into the industry to be able to do exactly what I've loved being able to do, which is sell people new homes and, and help them through that journey. You know, and it's been a fantastic industry. For me, I'm very passionate about the industry. I love every part about it. You know, it isn't always easy, but it is always enjoyable. So, you know, it's it's certainly been one of the most rewarding parts of my life. It's certainly been, you know, allowed me to meet some amazing people create some amazing friendships, both with work colleagues and with customers and being able to influence their lives in such positive ways. I think it's just fantastic. You know, for myself, I really love helping educate people about the industry and have enjoyed doing that. And you know, Collins are a testament to that when I took him on board many years ago and, you know, told me about how to sell houses and you know, that part I really enjoy and being able to impart that knowledge on others is fantastic and that's a big part of what the podcast for me personally is about is being able to share my knowledge and experience with with anyone who's willing to listen so you know, we're excited about the podcast and I must say Colin's done a lot of the work in the background to get this off the ground. I'm very much excited kicking this and wrapped to be so but I really appreciate everything you've done cold to get over Being together. So this can, you know, come together and be a great podcast, hopefully. So, yeah, thank you.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Colin 10:06 </p>
      <p>Thanks, Dez. So I guess to finish this off, we were just to help you understand a bit more of the plan for our our podcast in terms of the format. So we're gonna keep this pretty raw and real. You can see we're pretty much dressed in casuals, we're not really here to try and sell what we do or anything like that. We just want to sit here in a casual, I guess, a conversational format, provide as much value and education as we can. We will cover off topics, the first podcast, as you know what the second one after this will be all about finance. That's the first step you need to go through. And we've got a special guest on that for you. And then we're going to talk about some, you know, some educational things around building quotes and all those sorts of things. What it is you got to look out for you talk about display owners talk about the current state of the industry, and how we sort of got there, in terms of material delays, and shortages and all that sort of stuff, we're going to talk about the current date topic, and just better educate you ready so you can make your informed decision basically. So other than that, we will be recording this audio as a podcast, we're also recording via video. So we'll pop that onto a YouTube channel. And for anyone who sort of prefers that, that way of learning or listening, watching, I should say before we Vera, but other than that, that probably wraps it up or anything else to add does to our intro episode.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Darren 11:27 </p>
      <p>No, I think you know, we've obviously got really great connections to within the industry and the next episodes, one of those great connections and we really look forward to consistently bringing some of the big hitters to the table you know, and provide you as much value as possible with the content that's there with experts that you know, in their field so I'm excited about that side as well to bring some great people you know, yeah a lot along on the journey and it's going to be fun night really looking forward to the podcast so this first one off and excited to bring the rest along the way.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Colin 12:07 </p>
      <p>Yep. Well, guys, if you've got any topics, ideas, things like that, head to homebuilding hub.com.au. And there's a little box where you can just put your, your topic idea in there or any questions and we're happy to jump on board and come back and answer those for you. So other than that, thanks for listening to the intro episode. And we hope you really enjoyed this podcast and we'll see you on the next one. Thanks, guys.</p>
