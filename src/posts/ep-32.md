### Timestamps:

2:23 - What deposits are required when purchasing a house and land package (or house only)? 

5:08 - Don’t forget to factor in stamp duty, conveyancer costs, land transfer fees, mortgage insurance (if applicable).

5:53 - Understand the impact of progress payments on your cashflow… because you need to pay for each stage during your build, not all at the end.

9:25 - Get a conveyancer upfront and be sure to check your survey pegs on site

12:23 - Be aware… you are responsible for clearing your site, not your builder.

18:49 - Plan for and check your refrigerator space dimensions on the detailed drawings

20:45 - Expect to pay for rates and services (electricity and gas) from the day you settle your land, during your construction and connections after construction too.

23:22 - Understand the impact that neighbouring dwellings can have on your build.
