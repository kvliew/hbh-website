description: In this episode we give you a genuine insight into how builders’
  pricing really works, explaining how the last 2 years has impacted builders…
  and ultimately clients, trades and suppliers as well. Whilst we do discuss and
  acknowledge Porter Davis heading into liquidation, with respect to those
  involved we shift our focus to provide valuable insights to those who are
  considering buying right now. We explain the cause and effect of material
  shortages, delays and price increases and we also share some genuine reasons
  as to why you could consider purchasing now rather than waiting.
