description: We discuss and acknowledge Porter Davis heading into liquidation,
  but with respect to those involved, our focus shifts to providing valuable
  insights to those who are considering buying right now. We give you a genuine
  insight into how builders’ pricing really works, explaining how the last 2
  years has impacted builders… and ultimately clients, trades and suppliers as
  well. We explain the cause and effect of material shortages, delays and price
  increases and we also share some genuine reasons as to why you could consider
  purchasing now rather than waiting.
