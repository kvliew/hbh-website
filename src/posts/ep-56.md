description: "Insurance premiums are going up, but it is not all doom and gloom
  like the media reports. Join us as we reveal the increase amount and put it
  into perspective for you. We also share an emotional plea to the media to stop
  scaring people and offending those of us who have worked so hard to get some
  confidence back into our industry these past 2 years. "
