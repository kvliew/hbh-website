description: Site costs are one of the most confusing and complex components in
  new home construction. In this episode we explain what site costs are, how
  they work, what they are made up of and ultimately help you understand why
  they vary between every block of land. We begin the episode with a short and
  sharp summary for those that want only the basics, and then we move into the
  more detailed explanation for those of you wanting to learn a bit more.
