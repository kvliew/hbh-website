  tackling one of the biggest questions in the industry: Will I get my deposit
  back if I decide to cancel? In this episode, we break down the answer and dive
  deep into what a Preliminary Works Agreement really entails, what’s covered in
  your Preliminary Fee, what work is completed as part of that fee, and whether
