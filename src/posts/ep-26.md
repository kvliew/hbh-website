description: Join us as we dive into greenfield land estates and common lot
  types. Discover the distinctions between different lot types, sizes and even
  the different codes applying to blocks based on their overall size as well. We
  cover the meaning of site coverage and also give you valuable insights into
  setbacks, private open space and the impact of estate requirements.
