description: In this episode, we dive into the true meaning of "turnkey
  inclusions" and address how some builders misuse the term to attract buyers.
  We explain what genuine turnkey inclusions really are, and also explore which
  buyer types are likely to benefit most from turnkey inclusions. On the flip
  side, we also discuss why some might prefer a "home only" solution instead.
  Tune in to gain a clear understanding of turnkey inclusions and make an
  informed decision for your new home.
