description: We get it, no one wants to be sold to… but the reality is that
  there are a lot of variables when it comes to buying a house and/or land
  package, so it’s important for every buyer to give themselves the best chance
  to learn, understand and obtain the best solution for their needs. In this
  episode, we explain the ‘to dos’ and ‘not to dos’ when enquiring with a
  builder to give you the best opportunity to find the right solution for your
  needs.
