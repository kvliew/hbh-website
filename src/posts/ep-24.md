description: "Join us in this enlightening episode as we delve into the world of
  energy ratings and sustainable living. We kick off by introducing AI and
  machine learning into energy ratings, paving the way for a greener future.
  Discover the ins and outs of NatHERS (Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme)
  and what it takes to achieve a coveted 7-Star rating. Explore the key design
  elements impacted by these changes, and learn how land orientation and
  neighboring houses can influence your home's price. We also discuss the shift
  from 6-Star to 7-Star requirements, the associated costs, and the 'whole of
  home' perspective. Plus, we address whether now is the time to buy to avoid
  the new requirements and explore alternative materials for achieving higher
  energy ratings. "
