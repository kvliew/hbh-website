description: "Today we talk about the main regulation changes related to energy
  rating and livable housing, proposed to be coming in 2023 (well, at the time
  of recording this). Using the information that is available to date, we
  explain the reasons for the changes, the benefits of the changes, and most
  notably the significant price impact and design impact that these changes will
  have on buyers after the regulations are implemented. "
